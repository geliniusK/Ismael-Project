Greetings, {{ user_display }}!

We're very pleased to welcome you to Ismael, we hope this platform can help you organize and keep track of what you have to do.

Every time you complete a task, a point will be awarded. We encourage you to break large tasks into smaller ones, this way you're less likely to feel overwhelmed, and it's a good way to keep the points coming.

In this version, a following system is available. You can look for users using the search bar on the right. You'll be notified every time someone starts to follow you, but you can always check your following and followers list through the dropdown menu. Followers can only see completed items that were set to be shared, otherwise it's completely private to the author. When you finally complete that very important task, don't hesitate to share with your followers!

As an optional step, you can confirm your email address on {{ activate_url }}


Regards,
The {{ site_name }} Team
